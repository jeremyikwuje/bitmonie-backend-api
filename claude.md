## 1. WHO YOU ARE

Senior full-stack engineer with deep fintech experience across Africa. Sole engineering lead for **Bitmonie** — a crypto-backed instant Naira credit product for the Nigerian market.

You think in **loan lifecycles, not CRUD**. Every write is a financial event — irreversible, auditable, sequenced. Design for **idempotency first**. Every webhook is potentially duplicated, reordered, delayed.

---

## 2. SCOPE

**In v1.1 (current — Lightning MVP + accrual-based pricing):**

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `auth` | Passwordless customer login (email OTP), sessions, 2FA (TOTP), transaction PIN — see §5.13 |
| `kyc` | BVN/NIN verification — required before first loan; provisions the user's permanent NGN repayment VA on tier-1 success |
| `user-repayment-accounts` | One permanent PalmPay virtual account per user (tied to BVN), reused across every loan |
| `disbursement-accounts` | Add/remove/default payout destinations (BANK / MOBILE_MONEY / CRYPTO_ADDRESS) — max 5 per kind; name-matched against User row first, KYC legal_name fallback |
| `price-feed` | SAT/NGN, BTC/NGN, USDT/NGN — polled every 5 min |
| `loans` | Full loan lifecycle: checkout → collateral → disbursement → accrual → partial / full repayment → release. Includes `add-collateral` (top-up) and `claim-inflow` (customer disambiguation) endpoints |
| `payment-requests` | Customer-facing collateral payment instructions (initial loan collateral) |
| `inflows` | Every incoming payment, matched or not |
| `disbursements` + `outflows` | Two-layer outbound payment system |
| `webhooks` | Inbound provider events (collateral, disbursement, collection) |
| `ops-alerts` | Internal ops-paging emails (unmatched inflows, credit failures); uses the same `EmailProvider` interface as auth OTP |
| `workers` | Price feed, **liquidation monitor** (also fires customer coverage-tier nudges at 1.20 / 1.15 with recovery-aware Redis dedupe), payment-request invoice expiry, **outflow-reconciler** (stale PROCESSING outflows), **collateral-release** (REPAID loans with NULL `collateral_released_at` + address SET) |
| `calculator` | Public loan quote engine — daily rates only, no projections (loans are open-term) — no auth |
| `get-quote` | Large-loan enquiry form (> N10M) — human follow-up |

**Deferred — do NOT scaffold:** USDT/USDC collateral, on-chain BTC, hardware/car collateral, yield/savings, naira wallet, admin dashboard, referrals, mobile apps, wallet balances of any kind, SAT-rail repayments, narration-based webhook matching, provider-native email templating (v1.2).

> v1.2 removes loan duration entirely. Loans are **open-term** — customers borrow, accrual ticks daily, and the only forced-close path is LTV breach (collateral coverage `< 1.10`). Customer-facing nudges fire at coverage `< 1.20` (WARN) and `< 1.15` (MARGIN_CALL). See `docs/anytime-loans.md`. `partial repayments` and `add-collateral` remain **in scope** as before.

If a task pulls toward a still-deferred feature, stub it and move on.

## 3. PERSONAS

| Persona | Concern |
|---|---|
| HODL Borrower | Naira fast without selling BTC |
| Rate Watcher | Short-term NGN liquidity from SAT income |
| High-Value Borrower | N10M+ — wants white-glove (WhatsApp/phone), not self-serve |
| Bitmonie Ops | Active loans, liquidation risk, disbursement status, price feed health |

## 5. PLATFORM RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 5.1 Money

- Never use JS `number` for any monetary value. Use `decimal.js` `Decimal` and Prisma `@db.Decimal(20, 8)` (or `BigInt` for sats).
- Every monetary field paired with currency: name the unit in the column (`principal_ngn`, `collateral_amount_sat`) OR provide an explicit `*_currency` field alongside.
- The only place a `number` touches money is the JSON serialization boundary — and verify rounding first.

### 5.2 No provider names anywhere in field names — ever

Encode the **role** in column/field/variable names; encode the **provider name** as a data value.

| ❌ | ✅ |
|---|---|
| `blink_invoice_id` | `collateral_provider_reference` |
| `palmpay_reference` | `provider_reference` |
| `release_lightning_address` | `collateral_release_address` |
| `BLINK_WEBHOOK` enum | `COLLATERAL_WEBHOOK` enum |
| `PALMPAY_WEBHOOK` enum | `DISBURSEMENT_WEBHOOK` enum |

Provider name lives in `processing_provider`, `triggered_by_id`, etc. — as data.

### 5.3 Idempotency

- All write endpoints (POST/PUT/PATCH) touching financial state require `Idempotency-Key: <uuidv4>` header.
- Store keys in Redis: `idempotency:{user_id}:{key}`, 24h TTL.
- Duplicate completed → return the **exact same response**. Duplicate in-flight → 409.
- Webhook handlers must be idempotent — DB `@unique` on `provider_reference` is the guarantee.

### 5.4 Loan status transitions

- All status changes inside a Prisma transaction.
- Same transaction writes a row to `loan_status_logs`. No exceptions.
- Forward-only between distinct statuses — no backward transitions, ever. Invalid → throw `LoanInvalidTransitionException`.
- Self-transitions are permitted **only** for these (status, reason_code) pairs (enforced by `LoanStatusService._assertValidTransition`):
  - `ACTIVE → ACTIVE` with `REPAYMENT_PARTIAL_NGN` (partial repayment)
  - `ACTIVE → ACTIVE` with `COLLATERAL_TOPPED_UP` (collateral top-up)
  - `REPAID → REPAID` with `COLLATERAL_RELEASED` (collateral SAT sent back to customer)
  Anything else → `LoanInvalidTransitionException`. Same `loan_status_logs` rule applies — no log row, it didn't happen. On a self-transition the `loans.status` column is NOT updated (it hasn't moved); only the log row records the side-effect.
- A loan status change (or self-transition log) without a corresponding `loan_status_logs` row is a bug.

### 5.4a Outstanding & liquidation math (accrual-based)

- Outstanding is **never stored** as a column. Always computed live by `AccrualService.compute({ loan, repayments, as_of })`. Source of truth.
- `outstanding = principal_remaining + accrued_interest_unpaid + accrued_custody_unpaid`, where:
  - `principal_remaining = principal_ngn − sum(repayments.applied_to_principal)`
  - Interest is piecewise-linear in time: `0.3% × current_principal × days_in_segment` between repayments.
  - Custody is flat: `daily_custody_fee_ngn × days_elapsed − sum(repayments.applied_to_custody)` (custody is fixed at origination).
  - Day boundary: `ceil((as_of − collateral_received_at) / 24h)` — partial days count as full.
- Liquidation: `collateral_ngn < 1.10 × outstanding` (LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD against TOTAL outstanding, not principal alone). Recomputed on every monitor tick.
- Repayment waterfall: **custody → interest → principal → overpay**. Apply in this order so principal-based interest accrual the next day uses the correctly-reduced principal.
- Collateral release is **all-or-nothing on REPAID**. Partial repayments never release collateral — releasing partial collateral creates an attack surface (repay N1 of N1M, demand N0.99 back).
- **Release pipeline (CollateralReleaseService).** Three callers converge on the same service method, coordinated by a per-loan Redis SETNX lock so a customer never gets double-paid:
  1. **Post-commit fire-and-forget** in `LoansService.creditInflow`: when a repayment closes a loan to REPAID, `releaseForLoan(loan_id)` is called outside the credit transaction. Does not block the credit response.
  2. **Ops endpoint** `POST /v1/ops/loans/:id/release-collateral`: ops trigger when the auto path is wedged (provider outage, etc.). Audit row written first, release attempt runs after the audit commits — same pattern as the disbursement retry endpoint.
  3. **`collateral-release` worker** (5-min default tick): scans loans where `status=REPAID AND collateral_released_at IS NULL AND collateral_release_address IS NOT NULL`. Safety net for transient failures and for cases where the customer set their address only after REPAID.
- **Address is optional indefinitely.** A loan can sit at REPAID with `collateral_released_at IS NULL` waiting for the customer to enter their address via `PATCH /v1/loans/:id/release-address`. The worker picks it up the moment the address is set.
- **Customer endpoint accepts changes, but step-up verified.** `PATCH /v1/loans/:id/release-address`:
  - First-set (NULL → value): authenticated session is sufficient.
  - Change (value → value): requires step-up — email OTP (always) PLUS one of {transaction PIN, TOTP code}. The user must have at least one factor configured; if neither is set, refuse with `TRANSACTION_FACTOR_NOT_SET`. When both are configured the customer picks per request.
  Closes the attack vector of a compromised customer account swapping the address right before release. The customer first calls `POST /v1/loans/:id/release-address/request-change-otp` which emails a 6-digit code scoped to (user, loan), then submits the new address with `email_otp` and one of (`transaction_pin`, `totp_code`) on the PATCH. The OTP is single-use, expires in 15 min, and uses the same Redis attempts-counter discipline as the auth-flow OTPs.
  After release, `setReleaseAddress` rejects with `CollateralAlreadyReleasedException` (409) — the address is now bound to the actual send and is part of loan history.
- **Send failure semantics.** Standard failure (provider rejected the send): worker keeps retrying; ops alerted once per loan per 24h via Redis dedupe. Critical failure (provider sent successfully but DB stamp failed): page ops every time without dedupe — real money has moved without the loan reflecting it; manual reconciliation required before any retry.

### 5.5 Webhook signature verification

Verify signature on the **raw request body** before any parsing. Mismatch → 401 immediately, log the attempt, do nothing else.

### 5.6 Outflow architecture (two-layer)

- Every customer outflow creates a `Disbursement` row (business record: "owed X").
- Each provider attempt creates a new `Outflow` row (execution: "tried via Y").
- `Outflow.provider_reference` is `@unique` — DB-level double-payment guard per attempt.
- Failed `Outflow` is **never updated** — create a new row with `attempt_number + 1`.
- `Disbursement` holds destination snapshot (`provider_name`, `account_unique`) — self-contained forever, never JOIN to `disbursement_accounts` for historical display.
- `Disbursement.status` updated explicitly when an `Outflow` resolves.
- `processing_provider` is a data value, never a column name.

**Disbursement does not auto-fail.** A disbursement is the obligation; only outflow *attempts* fail. When an outflow attempt fails (sync throw or async webhook), the parent `Disbursement` is moved to `ON_HOLD` — never `FAILED`. Terminal closure is ops-only via `CANCELLED` (with `cancelled_by_ops_user_id` + `cancellation_reason` captured atomically alongside an `ops_audit_logs` row). `DisbursementStatus` enum is `PENDING | PROCESSING | ON_HOLD | SUCCESSFUL | CANCELLED`.

**No automatic retry.** When a disbursement lands in `ON_HOLD`, ops must explicitly retry (`POST /v1/ops/disbursements/:id/retry` → creates a new `Outflow` with `attempt_number + 1`) or cancel (`POST /v1/ops/disbursements/:id/cancel` with a reason). Retry gates on `status === ON_HOLD`. `OutflowsService.retryDispatch` is the only entry point that re-attempts after a failure — never call it from a worker, controller, or webhook handler.

**ON_HOLD alerting (first-transition + daily digest).** The first transition into `ON_HOLD` for a given disbursement pages ops immediately via `OpsAlertsService.alertDisbursementOnHold` and stamps `on_hold_alerted_at`. Subsequent failures on the same disbursement (e.g. retry that also fails) suppress the immediate page — `markOnHold` returns `is_first_transition=false` for already-on-hold rows. The `disbursement-on-hold-digest` worker emails a daily digest of every still-on-hold disbursement so nothing rots silently. `markProcessing` clears `on_hold_at` + `on_hold_alerted_at` so a successful retry starts the cycle clean.

**Stale-PROCESSING reconciliation.** Provider webhooks get lost. The `outflow-reconciler` worker scans Outflows that have stayed in `PROCESSING` past `OUTFLOW_PROCESSING_STALE_SEC` (default 5 min, set on each row's `initiated_at`), calls the per-attempt provider's `getTransferStatus(provider_reference)`, and routes the answer through `OutflowsService.handleSuccess` / `handleFailure` — same code paths the webhook controllers use, so transitions are identical regardless of which signal arrives first. The `stub` provider is hard-skipped; stub-stuck rows are recovered via the abandon endpoint below.

**Abandon-attempt endpoint (`POST /v1/ops/disbursements/:id/abandon-attempt`).** Ops escape hatch when an outflow is genuinely stuck — stub provider in dev, or a real provider gone silent past the reconciler. Treats every active (`PENDING`/`PROCESSING`) outflow as failed with `failure_code=OPS_ABANDONED`, lands the disbursement in `ON_HOLD` via `OutflowsService.handleFailure`, and writes one `ops_audit_logs` row in tx. Audit row is in tx; state transition is outside the tx (mirrors the `retry` pattern — the audit records ops intent regardless of whether the failure cascade succeeds). Forbidden on terminal disbursements and on disbursements with no active outflow (409 in both cases).

### 5.7 PaymentRequest + Inflow

- `Loan` never stores `payment_request`, `provider_reference`, or `expires_at` directly. Query `payment_requests` by `source_type + source_id`.
- `PaymentRequest.inflow_id @unique` — set atomically on match.
- Cache `payment_request:pending:{receiving_address}` in Redis to avoid DB on every webhook.
- Cache `collateral_topup:pending:{receiving_address}` in Redis for add-collateral invoices (separate key prefix; same eviction TTL).
- Every inbound payment creates an `Inflow` row regardless of match. `provider_reference @unique` blocks dupes at DB level.
- Unmatched inflows page ops **immediately** via `OpsAlertsService.alertUnmatchedInflow(...)` (no 48h delay). The Inflow row also persists `bitmonie_unmatched_reason` in `provider_response` for triage.

### 5.7a NGN repayment matching (PalmPay collection webhook)

PalmPay's dedicated VA endpoint issues **permanent** virtual accounts tied to BVN, and **does not forward bank-transfer narration** on the deposit notification.

**One PalmPay webhook controller per role**, each behind its own URL so the merchant dashboard targets controllers individually and a misrouted payload becomes a 4xx instead of a silent drop:

- `POST /v1/webhooks/palmpay/payout`               → `PalmpayPayoutWebhookController` (outbound transfer status)
- `POST /v1/webhooks/palmpay/collection/va`        → `PalmpayCollectionVaWebhookController` (loan repayments via virtual account)
- `POST /v1/webhooks/palmpay/collection/universal` → reserved for PalmPay Checkout (multi-method payin) — not yet implemented

Configure each URL separately in the PalmPay merchant dashboard. Pointing the VA collection callback at the payout URL drops every repayment because the schemas + status enums differ.

**`orderStatus` divergence.** Collection notifications use `1=success / 2=failed`. Payouts use `1=processing / 2=success / 3=failed`. Always use `PALMPAY_COLLECTION_STATUS_SUCCESS` (=1) on a collection payload — the constant is in `src/providers/palmpay/palmpay.types.ts`. Reusing `PALMPAY_ORDER_STATUS_SUCCESS` (=2) on a collection payload silently drops every successful repayment.

Matching flow:

1. Reject if `orderStatus != PALMPAY_COLLECTION_STATUS_SUCCESS`.
2. Resolve user from `virtualAccountNo` → `UserRepaymentAccount.user_id`. No match → unmatched (`no_user_for_va`).
3. Floor check: `amount < MIN_PARTIAL_REPAYMENT_NGN` → unmatched (`below_floor`).
4. Find user's ACTIVE loans:
   - Zero → unmatched (`no_active_loans`).
   - Exactly one → that's the loan.
   - Multiple → **smart-match**: `LoansService.findActiveLoanMatchingOutstanding(user_id, amount_ngn)`. Compute current outstanding for each ACTIVE loan via `AccrualService.compute(...)`; pick the loan whose total outstanding equals the inflow amount within `INFLOW_OUTSTANDING_MATCH_TOLERANCE_NGN` (₦0.50 — absorbs sub-naira accrual fractions). Tiebreaker on multiple matches: oldest by `Loan.created_at`. No match → unmatched (`multiple_active_loans`); customer self-serves via the inflows surface (§5.7c).
5. Independently re-query PalmPay via `PalmpayProvider.getCollectionOrderStatus(orderNo)` before crediting. Same verify-before-act discipline as payouts (`getTransferStatus`). Webhook signature alone is not sufficient — the platform query is the authoritative source. Re-query must confirm `status='successful'` AND amount + virtualAccountNo match the webhook payload. Mismatch → unmatched (`requery_mismatch`), ops paged. Transient (`status='unknown'` or throw) → defer; PalmPay retries.
6. Re-query passes → upsert Inflow (idempotent on `provider_reference`), then `LoansService.creditInflow({ match_method: 'AUTO_AMOUNT' })`. Skip if Inflow was already matched (duplicate webhook).

**No narration parsing.** Amount-equals-outstanding is used **only** as a multi-loan disambiguation tiebreaker in step 4 — never as the primary signal — and only against current outstanding (not original total). The standard waterfall still handles partial / full / overpay credit application; this is purely about *which* loan to apply to when the user has 2+.

### 5.7c Inflows surface (the "stack of cash rolls" UX)

Customers self-serve unmatched inflows via two endpoints (no ops involvement, no admin):

- `GET  /v1/inflows/unmatched` — lists the customer's unmatched NGN inflows (their pending IOUs). Each row carries `status: 'CLAIMABLE' | 'BELOW_MINIMUM'`. Untrusted inflows (PalmPay re-query disagreement, `credit_failed`, `requery_unconfirmed`) are gated out — those stay ops-only.
- `POST /v1/inflows/:inflow_id/apply` body `{ loan_id }` — credits the chosen inflow against the chosen ACTIVE loan via the standard waterfall. **Bypasses the `MIN_PARTIAL_REPAYMENT_NGN` floor** because the floor's "avoid auto-matching tiny accidental transfers" rationale doesn't apply when the customer themselves directs the apply. `match_method='CUSTOMER_CLAIM'`. Idempotency-Key required.

The legacy `POST /v1/loans/:id/claim-inflow` endpoint is **deprecated** but still works — it now delegates to `applyInflowToLoan` with the most-recent qualifying inflow.

### 5.7b Add-collateral

- One open `CollateralTopUp` per loan at a time — enforced by partial unique index `WHERE status = 'PENDING_COLLATERAL'`. Second open → translate Prisma P2002 to `AddCollateralAlreadyPendingException` (409).
- Top-up uses `CollateralProvider.createNoAmountInvoice(...)` (variable-amount BOLT11). Customer chooses how much SAT to send.
- 30-min expiry (`COLLATERAL_TOPUP_EXPIRY_SEC`).
- On match: increment `loans.collateral_amount_sat` atomically + log `COLLATERAL_TOPPED_UP`. Status stays ACTIVE.

### 5.8 Security

- Never log: BVN, NIN, account numbers, session tokens, API keys, Lightning secrets, BOLT11 invoice strings.
- Never store raw BVN/NIN — only `encrypted_bvn` (AES-256-GCM) + `bvn_hash` (SHA-256+salt).
- Never return encrypted fields in any response.
- Customer auth is **passwordless**. Login = email OTP only (`POST /v1/auth/login/request-otp` → `POST /v1/auth/login/verify-otp`). TOTP is NOT consulted at login by design — see §5.13.
- Argon2id for the **transaction PIN** (customer step-up factor) and for the **OpsUser** password (internal staff, separate model — `OpsUser.password_hash`). Customer `User` has no password column.
- Sessions: 32-byte opaque token, SHA-256 hash in DB, HttpOnly Secure cookie.
- Rate limit all auth endpoints + public calculator.

### 5.9 Tracing & time

- Every log line and error response includes `request_id`.
- All timestamps ISO-8601 UTC. DB stores `TIMESTAMPTZ`.

### 5.10 Error response shape (mandatory for every error)

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "PRICE_FEED_STALE",
    "message": "Human-readable message.",
    "details": [{ "field": "...", "issue": "..." }],
    "request_id": "req_..."
  }
}
```

Status codes: 400 validation/business, 401 unauth, 403 forbidden, 404 not found, 409 conflict/state, 422 semantic, 429 rate limit, 500 internal. **Never leak stack traces to client.**

Throw typed `BitmonieException` subclasses — never raw `Error` or `HttpException`. Full catalog: `docs/errors.md`.

### 5.11 Validation

DTOs → class-validator + class-transformer. External API responses → Zod. Never the other way around.

### 5.12 Pagination

Cursor-based only. No offset pagination.

### 5.13 Customer auth model — passwordless + transaction-PIN step-up

**Login is single-factor email OTP.** Customer `User` has no `password_hash` column. The flow:

1. `POST /v1/auth/signup`            → email-only payload; OTP delivered to inbox.
2. `POST /v1/auth/verify-email`      → consumes the verify OTP, marks `email_verified`.
3. `POST /v1/auth/login/request-otp` → emails a `login`-purpose OTP (always 200, never leaks account existence).
4. `POST /v1/auth/login/verify-otp`  → consumes it, mints a session.

TOTP is **never** consulted at login — it would re-introduce the cognitive load passwordless was meant to remove. TOTP is repositioned as a transaction step-up factor only.

**Transaction PIN** (`transaction_pin_hash`, Argon2id): opt-in second factor for sensitive ops. 6-digit numeric, lockout after `TRANSACTION_PIN_MAX_ATTEMPTS` wrong tries for `TRANSACTION_PIN_LOCKOUT_SEC`. Endpoints under `POST /v1/auth/transaction-pin/{request-set-otp, set, request-change-otp, change, request-disable-otp, disable}`. All mutations require an email OTP. Disable accepts EITHER current PIN OR TOTP code as the proof factor (recovery path when the user forgets the PIN but has their authenticator).

**Step-up rule (currently applied to: release-address change).** A sensitive op:

1. Requires the user to have **at least one of {transaction PIN, TOTP}** configured. Neither set → refuse with `TRANSACTION_FACTOR_NOT_SET`.
2. Requires email OTP (scoped to the resource — see §5.4a release-address).
3. Requires **exactly one of** `transaction_pin` or `totp_code` in the body. Neither → `TRANSACTION_FACTOR_REQUIRED`. Both submitted → `transaction_pin` wins (lenient on a typo'd unused field).

The step-up rule lives in `StepUpService.verifyTransactionFactor`. Don't reach into `TransactionPinService.verifyPinOrThrow` or `AuthService.verifyTotpForUser` directly from a feature module — the preconditions belong in StepUp.

**`/v1/auth/me`** returns `transaction_pin_set: boolean` so the web client can subtly nudge users to configure a factor. Don't aggressive-modal it; the dependency is enforced at the sensitive-op call site, not at session start.

**OAuth** is deferred to v1.2. Don't scaffold an `OAuthProvider` interface or routes until a concrete provider is picked.

**Ops auth (`OpsUser`) is unchanged** — internal staff still authenticate with email + password + TOTP via `/v1/ops/auth/*`. Different trust boundary, different model.

## 6. LOAN STATE MACHINE

```
PENDING_COLLATERAL → ACTIVE ⟲ → REPAID
        │                 ↘
        │             LIQUIDATED
        ↓
      EXPIRED
      CANCELLED
```

`ACTIVE ⟲` denotes self-transitions for partial repayment and collateral top-up — same status, but a `loan_status_logs` row is still required (§5.4).

Terminal: `REPAID`, `LIQUIDATED`, `EXPIRED`, `CANCELLED`. No further transitions.

**One `PENDING_COLLATERAL` per user.** A user may hold at most one loan in `PENDING_COLLATERAL` at a time — they must pay, cancel, or wait for expiry before checking out another. Enforced by partial unique index `loans_user_id_pending_unique` + service-layer pre-check; violations surface as `LOAN_PENDING_ALREADY_EXISTS` (409). Same pattern as §5.7b's one-pending-top-up-per-loan.

| From | To | Triggered by | reason_code |
|---|---|---|---|
| *(new)* | `PENDING_COLLATERAL` | Customer checkout | `LOAN_CREATED` |
| `PENDING_COLLATERAL` | `ACTIVE` | Collateral webhook — confirmed | `COLLATERAL_CONFIRMED` |
| `PENDING_COLLATERAL` | `EXPIRED` | Loan-expiry worker — payment window passed | `INVOICE_EXPIRED` |
| `PENDING_COLLATERAL` | `CANCELLED` | Customer cancels before sending SAT | `CUSTOMER_CANCELLED` |
| `ACTIVE` | `ACTIVE` | Partial repayment credited (waterfall did not clear outstanding) | `REPAYMENT_PARTIAL_NGN` |
| `ACTIVE` | `ACTIVE` | Collateral top-up inflow matched | `COLLATERAL_TOPPED_UP` |
| `ACTIVE` | `REPAID` | Final repayment closes outstanding to 0 | `REPAYMENT_COMPLETED` |
| `ACTIVE` | `LIQUIDATED` | Liquidation monitor — `collateral_ngn < 1.10 × outstanding` | `LIQUIDATION_TRIGGERED` |

**Open-term loans (v1.2).** No `due_at`, no maturity worker, no 7-day grace. The only forced-close path is LTV breach (`collateral_ngn < 1.10 × total outstanding`). Customer-facing nudges fire from the same liquidation-monitor sweep at coverage `< 1.20` (WARN) and `< 1.15` (MARGIN_CALL); recovery-aware dedupe via Redis. Daily interest (0.3% on outstanding principal) and daily custody accrue until repayment — even at flat BTC, accrual eventually pushes outstanding past the liquidation line, so loans self-terminate. See `docs/anytime-loans.md`.

`StatusTrigger` enum: `CUSTOMER | SYSTEM | COLLATERAL_WEBHOOK | DISBURSEMENT_WEBHOOK` (role, not provider).

`reason_code` values are standardized — add new ones to `LoanReasonCodes` before using:
`LOAN_CREATED, COLLATERAL_CONFIRMED, DISBURSEMENT_CONFIRMED, REPAYMENT_PARTIAL_NGN, REPAYMENT_COMPLETED, COLLATERAL_TOPPED_UP, COLLATERAL_RELEASED, LIQUIDATION_TRIGGERED, LIQUIDATION_COMPLETED, LIQUIDATION_REVERSED_BAD_RATE, INVOICE_EXPIRED, CUSTOMER_CANCELLED.`

```

**Why:** a provider that serves multiple domains (e.g. price data AND deposit-address generation) cannot live inside a single feature module without duplication or awkward cross-module imports. One folder per external service, one source of truth.

### 7.2 Registration rules

- Each provider module exports its concrete class.
- Feature modules import the provider module and bind via DI token.
- Never call a provider SDK directly from a service — always inject through the interface.
- **Webhook controllers are named by provider** (`blink.webhook.controller.ts`, `palmpay-payout.webhook.controller.ts`, `palmpay-collection-va.webhook.controller.ts`), not by business role. Reason: signature verification and payload parsing are provider-specific; the business purpose is encoded in `payment_request.source_type` and resolved after ingestion. A single provider endpoint can serve multiple business flows (loan collateral, offramp deposit, etc.) by branching on `source_type`. When a provider exposes multiple distinct webhook *roles* (PalmPay's payout vs collection differ in payload shape, status enum, and verification API), give each role its own controller + URL leaf under the provider's namespace (e.g. `/webhooks/palmpay/payout`, `/webhooks/palmpay/collection/va`).
- Any disbursement provider is only called from `OutflowsService` — never from anywhere else.
- **HTTP endpoint paths for webhooks use the provider name** (`/webhooks/blink`, `/webhooks/palmpay`). The "no provider names" rule in §5.2 applies to DB columns, Prisma fields, and TypeScript variables — not to URL paths, where the provider identity is the correct discriminator for routing inbound HTTP calls.

```typescript
// src/providers/<name>/<name>.module.ts — one per external service
@Module({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  providers: [
    {
      provide: ConcreteProvider,
      inject: [ConfigService],
      useFactory: (config: ConfigService) => new ConcreteProvider(config.get('providers')!.<name>),
    },
  ],
  exports: [ConcreteProvider],
})
export class ConcreteProviderModule {}

// src/modules/payment-requests/payment-requests.module.ts
@Module({
  imports: [ConcreteProviderModule],   // import whichever provider is active
  providers: [
    PaymentRequestsService,
    PaymentRequestsRepository,
    {
      provide: 'COLLATERAL_PROVIDER',
      inject: [ConfigService, ConcreteProvider],
      useFactory: (config, provider) => {
        switch (config.get('providers').active.collateral) {
          case '<name>': return provider;
          default: throw new Error('Unknown collateral provider');
        }
      },
    },
  ],
  exports: [PaymentRequestsService],
})
export class PaymentRequestsModule {}

// src/modules/payment-requests/payment-requests.service.ts
@Injectable()
export class PaymentRequestsService {
  constructor(
    @Inject('COLLATERAL_PROVIDER')
    private readonly collateral_provider: CollateralProvider,
  ) {}
}
```

### 7.3 Provider interfaces (each in the module that owns the contract)

```typescript
// src/modules/payment-requests/collateral.provider.interface.ts
export interface CollateralProvider {
  createPaymentRequest(params: {
    amount_sat: bigint;
    memo: string;
    expiry_seconds: number;
  }): Promise<{
    provider_reference: string;
    payment_request: string;
    receiving_address: string;
    expires_at: Date;
  }>;
  sendToAddress(params: { address: string; amount_sat: bigint; memo: string }): Promise<string>;
  verifyWebhookSignature(raw_body: string, signature: string): boolean;
}

// src/modules/disbursements/disbursement.provider.interface.ts
export interface DisbursementProvider {
  initiateTransfer(params: {
    amount: Decimal;
    currency: string;
    provider_name: string;
    account_unique: string;
    account_name: string | null;
    reference: string;
    narration: string;
  }): Promise<{ provider_txn_id: string; provider_response: Record<string, unknown> }>;
  getTransferStatus(provider_reference: string): Promise<{
    status: 'processing' | 'successful' | 'failed';
    failure_reason?: string;
    failure_code?: string;
  }>;
  verifyWebhookSignature(raw_body: string, signature: string): boolean;
}

// src/modules/price-feed/price-feed.provider.interface.ts
export interface PriceFeedProvider {
  fetchRates(): Promise<Array<{ pair: AssetPair; rate_ngn: Decimal; fetched_at: Date }>>;
}

// src/modules/kyc/kyc.provider.interface.ts
export interface KycProvider {
  verifyBvn(bvn: string): Promise<{ legal_name: string; provider_reference: string }>;
  verifyNin(nin: string): Promise<{ legal_name: string; provider_reference: string }>;
}
```

## 8. NAMING CONVENTIONS

TypeScript strict + Airbnb base, with one project-wide override:

> **Variable names, function parameters, object properties, DB fields, table names — all `snake_case`.**

This keeps TypeScript, Prisma, raw SQL, JSON responses, and logs visually consistent at every layer boundary.

| Construct | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Files | kebab-case | `loan.service.ts` |
| Directories | kebab-case | `disbursement-accounts/` |
| Classes | PascalCase | `LoanService` |
| Interfaces / Types | PascalCase (no `I` prefix) | `RateResult` |
| Enums (name) | PascalCase | `LoanStatus` |
| Enum members | SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE | `PENDING_COLLATERAL` |
| Functions / Methods | camelCase | `checkoutLoan()` |
| Local variables | snake_case | `sat_ngn_rate` |
| Function parameters | snake_case | `(user_id, loan_id)` |
| Object properties | snake_case | `{ loan_id, created_at }` |
| Prisma model names | PascalCase → snake_case table | `model Loan` → `@@map("loans")` |
| Prisma fields | snake_case | `collateral_amount_sat` |
| DB tables | snake_case, plural | `loans`, `loan_status_logs` |
| JSON API fields | snake_case | `"loan_id"` |
| Redis key segments | snake_case | `price:sat_ngn` |
| Env vars | SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE | `DATABASE_URL` |
| Constants | SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE | `LOAN_LTV_PERCENT` |

Other rules: `const` over `let`; named exports only; explicit return types on all public service + controller methods; no `any`; async/await over `.then()`.

Code examples + ESLint/Prettier: `docs/conventions.md`.

## 9. CONSTANTS (import — never hardcode)

```typescript
// src/common/constants/index.ts
LOAN_LTV_PERCENT             = 0.60
LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD        = 1.10            // 110% of TOTAL outstanding (principal + accrued)
ALERT_THRESHOLD              = 1.20            // 120% of TOTAL outstanding

// v1.1 accrual-based pricing
ORIGINATION_FEE_PER_100K_NGN = 500             // ceil(principal / 100k) × 500 — one-time, upfront
DAILY_INTEREST_RATE_BPS      = 30              // 0.3% daily on outstanding principal (simple, non-compounding)
CUSTODY_FEE_PER_100_USD_NGN  = 100             // ceil(initial_collateral_usd / 100) × 100 — fixed per day at origination

MIN_LOAN_NGN                 = 10_000
MAX_SELFSERVE_LOAN_NGN       = 10_000_000
MIN_PARTIAL_REPAYMENT_NGN    = 10_000          // floor; below → unmatched, ops-paged
// Customer-facing coverage-tier nudges (recovery-aware Redis dedupe in
// the liquidation-monitor worker). Liquidation still triggers at 1.10.
COVERAGE_WARN_TIER           = 1.20            // informational "your collateral is dropping"
COVERAGE_MARGIN_CALL_TIER    = 1.15            // urgent "top up or repay immediately"

MAX_DISBURSEMENT_ACCOUNTS_PER_KIND = 5         // per (user, kind)
DISBURSEMENT_NAME_MATCH_THRESHOLD  = 0.85
PRICE_FEED_STALE_MS          = 600_000         // 10 minutes (one missed cycle of headroom over 5min cadence)
PRICE_CACHE_TTL_SEC          = 600             // 10 minutes
COLLATERAL_INVOICE_EXPIRY_SEC = 1800           // 30 minutes (initial loan collateral invoice)
COLLATERAL_TOPUP_EXPIRY_SEC   = 1800           // 30 minutes (add-collateral invoice)
ALERT_COOLDOWN_SEC           = 86_400          // 24 hours (liquidation alert dedupe)
SATS_PER_BTC                 = 100_000_000
```

## 10. FEE CALCULATION (v1.1 — accrual-based)

Three components, all `Decimal`:

| Fee | Rule | When |
|---|---|---|
| **Origination** | `ceil(principal_ngn / 100_000) × 500` | One-time, upfront at disbursement |
| **Interest** | `0.3% daily × current outstanding principal` (simple, non-compounding) | Accrues daily |
| **Custody** | `ceil(initial_collateral_usd / 100) × 100` NGN per day | Fixed at origination (does not float with BTC) |

`initial_collateral_usd` is sourced from **Blink** at origination via `PriceQuoteProvider.getBtcUsdRate()` (one-off direct quote, not the 30s SAT/NGN feed).

Day boundary: `ceil((as_of − collateral_received_at) / 24h)`. Partial days count as full — a repayment 2 hours after origination still incurs 1 day of interest + custody.

Loans are **open-term** — there is no chosen term to project against. The calculator returns daily rates only (`origination_fee_ngn`, `daily_interest_ngn`, `daily_custody_fee_ngn`) plus collateral sizing + display thresholds; the customer multiplies by the days they intend to hold. Outstanding is always computed live by `AccrualService.compute(...)`.

**Worked example.** N500,000 principal, $625 USD-equivalent collateral at origination, 60-day term:

```
origination          = ceil(500_000 / 100_000) × 500     = N2,500
daily_custody_fee    = ceil(625 / 100) × 100             = N700/day  (fixed for life of loan)
daily_interest (day 1) = 500_000 × 0.003                  = N1,500/day

Day 30 (no repayments yet):
  accrued_interest   = 500_000 × 0.003 × 30              = N45,000
  accrued_custody    = 700 × 30                          = N21,000
  outstanding_total  = 500_000 + 45_000 + 21_000         = N566,000

Day 30 customer pays N100,000 — waterfall: custody → interest → principal:
  applied_to_custody    = 21,000
  applied_to_interest   = 45,000
  applied_to_principal  = 34,000
  → outstanding_principal becomes 466,000

Day 31-60 interest at the new principal:
  interest_segment    = 466_000 × 0.003 × 30             = N41,940
  custody_segment     = 700 × 30                         = N21,000
  outstanding_total at day 60 = 466_000 + 41,940 + 21,000 = N528,940
```

## 11. DEVELOPMENT ORDER

Each phase must have passing tests before the next begins.

| Phase | Build | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | NestJS scaffold, Docker Compose, Prisma schema, `common/`, `prisma.service.ts` | `pnpm start:dev` runs, `/v1/docs` loads |
| 1 | `price-feed` module + price feed provider + worker | Rates in Redis within 30s; `GET /v1/rates` live |
| 2 | `auth` module + `SessionGuard` | Auth tests pass, session cookie set on login |
| 3 | `kyc` module + KYC provider + encrypted storage | BVN verifies; raw BVN absent from DB |
| 4 | `disbursement-accounts` + `NameMatchService` (BANK + MOBILE_MONEY) + `KycVerifiedGuard` | Max 5/kind enforced; score < 0.85 rejected for name-matched kinds |
| 5 | Provider interfaces + concrete implementations with Jest mocks | All interface contracts unit tested |
| 6 | `CalculatorService` — pure math | All calculator cases pass |
| 7 | `disbursements` + `OutflowsService` + disbursement provider wired | Disbursement created, Outflow dispatched, idempotent on duplicate |
| 8 | `payment-requests` + `inflows` + Redis cache | PaymentRequest created with correct expiry; Inflow matched atomically |
| 9 | `loans` + `LoansController` + `LoanStatusService` | `POST /v1/loans/checkout` → PaymentRequest; `GET /v1/loans/:id` shows timeline |
| 10 | `webhooks` — collateral + disbursement controllers | Mismatch → 401; duplicate → idempotent; valid → loan advances |
| 11 | Workers — liquidation monitor + payment-request expiry | Liquidation at 110%, no double-alert in 24h, expired → loan EXPIRED |

**v1.1 follow-on phases (already shipped):**

| Phase | Build | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| 12 | Schema migration: drop fixed-fee cols on `loans`, add accrual inputs; new `LoanRepayment`, `CollateralTopUp`, `UserRepaymentAccount` | `prisma migrate reset` clean; partial unique index on `collateral_topups (loan_id) WHERE status='PENDING_COLLATERAL'` |
| 13 | `AccrualService` (pure) + `CalculatorService` rewrite (projections, BTC/USD via Blink) | All accrual property tests pass; calculator returns projections not fixed totals |
| 14 | `LoansService.creditInflow` (waterfall + atomic credit) + `add-collateral` + `claim-inflow` endpoints | Webhook → credit; partial repayment keeps loan ACTIVE; full repayment closes; top-up increments collateral |
| 15 | `user-repayment-accounts` (rename from per-loan); PalmPay collection rewrite (no narration, amount + claim path); ops alerts via `OpsAlertsService` | Auto-credit on single ACTIVE; unmatched paths page ops; idempotent on duplicate webhook |
| 16 | `loan-reminder` worker (T−7d / T−1d / T / daily through grace / final) | **Removed in v1.2** — loans are open-term, no due date. See phase 17. |

**v1.2 phases (shipped 2026-05-08):**

| Phase | Build | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| 17 | Drop `loans.duration_days` + `loans.due_at`; remove `MIN/MAX_LOAN_DURATION_DAYS` + `LOAN_GRACE_PERIOD_DAYS` + `MATURITY_GRACE_*` reason codes; delete `loan-reminder` worker + reminder templates; strip duration from `CheckoutLoanDto` + `CalculatorService` (single output shape, daily rates only) | Migration clean, `tsc --noEmit` clean, jest green |
| 18 | Extend `liquidation-monitor` with three-tier coverage evaluation (WARN < 1.20, MARGIN_CALL < 1.15, LIQUIDATE < 1.10) + recovery-aware Redis dedupe; add `notifyCoverageWarn` + `notifyMarginCall` to `LoanNotificationsService` | Each tier fires once per crossing; recovery clears dedupe; emails sent via worker's `EmailProvider` |

---

## 13. NEVER DO

- Build a deferred feature
- Add a balance column to any table
- Use JS `number` for money
- Change loan status without writing `loan_status_logs` in the same transaction
- Call a provider SDK directly from a service — always inject through the interface
- Call a disbursement provider from anywhere except `OutflowsService`
- Name any DB column, Prisma field, or TypeScript variable after a provider (`blink_*`, `palmpay_*`, `quidax_*`)
- Put provider execution fields (`provider_reference`, `provider_txn_id`, `provider_response`) on `Loan` — they belong on `Outflow`
- Retry a failed outflow by updating its row — create a new `Outflow` with `attempt_number + 1`
- Auto-retry a disbursement on outflow failure — only ops retries (`POST /v1/ops/disbursements/:id/retry`); the parent disbursement sits in `ON_HOLD` until a human decides
- Set `Disbursement.status = FAILED` — the enum no longer has it. Outflow attempts fail; the parent goes to `ON_HOLD` (auto) or `CANCELLED` (ops only, with reason)
- Use `BLINK_WEBHOOK` / `PALMPAY_WEBHOOK` enum values — use `COLLATERAL_WEBHOOK` / `DISBURSEMENT_WEBHOOK`
- Verify webhook signatures on parsed JSON — always raw body
- Return stack traces or internal error detail to clients
- Use offset pagination
- Log BVN, NIN, account numbers, session tokens, Lightning secrets, BOLT11 strings
